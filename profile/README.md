## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

openFyde is the open-source version of FydeOS, based on Chromium OS.

In this repository, you will find numerous individual repositories arranged in a flat hierarchy (thanks to GitHub not offering a directory structure ðŸ« ). We hope the following information helps you navigate the repository more easily:

- To learn the basics about getting started with building and developing openFyde, check out the [Getting started](https://github.com/openFyde/getting-started) guide.
- To download the pre-built image for supported hardware devices, find them under the "Releases" tab in the corresponding "overlay" repository. For a helpful spreadsheet listing all supported devices, visit <https://openfyde.io>.
- To report an issue related to openFyde, please do so in the corresponding overlay repository of the affected device.

We hope you enjoy working with openFyde, and we look forward to your valuable contributions to this open-source project. If you have any questions or require assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the community or the project maintainers.
